# Concave Hull
Finds the concave hull around a set of 2D points by leveraging the Delaunay triangulation. The concavity of the hull depends on a scalar ranging from 0 to 1 called the chi factor. A value of 0 leads to the most concave, and 1 leads to the convex hull.

This is a relatively fast implementation based on a paper from M. Duckham, et al [1], and uses the Delaunay triangulation implementation from [https://github.com/delfrrr/delaunator-cpp](https://github.com/delfrrr/delaunator-cpp). The paper uses the term __*characteristic shape*__ to refer to the shapes generated by the algorithm.

The algorithm begins by finding the Delaunay triagulation of a set of 2D points, initializes the hull to the convex hull, then iteratively adds points to the hull until some stopping condition is met. The iterative process looks at the largest triangle edges on the outside hull, and if the other triangle point is not also on the hull, proceeds to remove this edge and add the two other edges connected to this point.

# Installation

``` bash
pip install .
```

# Usage

``` python
from concavehull import concavehull

# 2D points
n = 1000
pts = np.random.randn(n, 2)

ch = concavehull(pts, chi_factor=0.05)

plt.scatter(pts[:,0], pts[:,1], label="points")
plt.plot(ch[:,0], ch[:,1], label="concave hull")
```
